// Server-side resolution of the retry policy; see docs/LLM重试设计.md. Of the five layers:
//   - connect / empty response / same-provider safety window "follow the endpoint":
//     each LLM config may override the global default (a field left empty in the
//     profile inherits the global value; if the global value is unset too, the
//     built-in default applies);
//   - circuit breaker / intent rerun are process-wide, with a single global copy.
//
// The global policy is a single settings row read from the DB. Every call site is on a
// low-frequency path (building a provider, finishing a work, saving a config), so
// another cache layer is not worth it. The circuit-breaker parameters are the
// exception: they are read on every failure path, so applyRetryPolicy pushes them
// into the Registry, which holds them.

// retryPolicy reads the global policy; a nil DB yields the zero policy (all
// layers on their built-in defaults).

// emptyTurnNudgeLimit resolves how many empty-turn continuations one work may
// inject (see steerHooks.Stop). It deliberately reuses layer ②'s knob, the "empty
// response retry count": the two are two means to the same end. The SDK layer
// handles "not a single content block at all" by resending the same request as is;
// this layer handles "only thinking, with neither text nor tools" by appending an
// instruction that lets the model continue from its existing thinking (resending as
// is would be pointless for this kind of idling, which is determined by the shape of
// the context). The emptiness criteria differ because the SDK goes by "has any
// event been yielded", while a thinking delta is itself an event. But when the user
// configures "how many times to retry on an empty response" they mean "try again
// when the model produced no substantive content", so sharing one count across both
// layers matches that mental model.
//
// It reads the global policy rather than any profile's override: a run may switch
// profile midway because of failover, and this is the total cap for the whole
// intent, so it should not change with the endpoint. The semantics are isomorphic to
// the SDK's emptyRetries(): 0 = default defaultEmptyTurnNudges; -1 (negative) =
// disable empty-turn continuation; >0 = use that value.
